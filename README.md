# PHP 5.3 Apache

PHP 5.3 [reached EOL](http://php.net/eol.php) on 14 Aug 2014 and thus, official docker support was [dropped](https://github.com/docker-library/php/pull/20). I still needed to run 5.3 so I built this image based on the latest official builds of PHP.

# What is PHP?

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development, but which can also be used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP can be added to straight HTML or it can be used with a variety of templating engines and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by an interpreter, which is either implemented as a native module on the web-server or as a common gateway interface (CGI).

# How to use this image.

## With Command Line

For PHP projects run through the command line interface (CLI), you can do the following.

### Create a `Dockerfile` in your PHP project

    FROM plutonianbe/php53-apache:latest
    COPY . /usr/src/myapp
    WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp
    CMD [ "php", "./your-script.php" ]

Then, run the commands to build and run the Docker image:

    docker build -t my-php-app .
    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-php-app

### Run a single PHP script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a PHP script by using the PHP Docker image directly:

    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp plutonianbe/php53-apache:latest php your-script.php

### Installing modules

To install additional modules use a `Dockerfile` like this:

``` Dockerfile
FROM plutonianbe/php53-apache:latest

# Installs curl
RUN docker-php-ext-install curl
```

Then build the image:

``` bash
$ docker build -t my-php .
```

### Without a `Dockerfile`

If you don't want to include a `Dockerfile` in your project, it is sufficient to do the following:

``` bash
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-php-app -v "$PWD":/var/www/html plutonianbe/php53-apache:latest
```

### Use image with `docker-compose`

```yml
version: "3.1"
services:

    app:
        image: plutonianbe/php53-apache:latest
        depends_on:
            - mysql
        environment:
            - XDEBUG_CONFIG=remote_host=${EN0IP}
        links:
            - mysql
        ports:
            - 80:80
        restart: always
        volumes:
            - ./:/var/www/html

       # Optional container if you are using mysql. Don't forget to change the credentials
    mysql:
        image: mysql:5.5
        environment:
            - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
            - MYSQL_DATABASE=app
            - MYSQL_USER=app
            - MYSQL_PASSWORD=app
        ports:
            - 3306:3306
        volumes:
            - ./docker/data:/var/lib/mysql
```

If you want to use xdebug don't forget to set the env variable `EN0IP`. For example add `export EN0IP=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0)` to you `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.
